# Flataculties App
Flataculties is an app where you can vote for the cutest animal. For this App, I have used a local API to build out the frontend for our app, Flatacuties.
I also did fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

## Functionalities
1. When you click on an animal, you get to see the number of votes it got and its cute image as well.
2. By a click of a button (labeled reset), you can reset the votes counter to zero.This applies to all the children in the list.
3. When viewing an animal’s details, you should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the project repository
2. Open the index.html file alongside db.json,script.js and style.css in your favorite code editor (i recommend VSCode)
   or Host it on a web server, then access it from your browser by typing the relevant URL.
3. Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json.
4. Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:3000/characters .

## Requirements
- You need to have VSCode installed.
- You need a locally hosted Postman app. Install it beforehand.

## Language Used:
- JavaScript
